    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.It is the language used to style an HTML document — meaning
        it controls how your website looks and feels (colors, layout, fonts, animations, etc.).</p>

    <!-- Here is the example of External CSS -->
    <h3>Why use CSS?</h3>
    <p> 1.Controls the Design and Layout:
        CSS allows you to add styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and borders. It controls how HTML elements look on
        the screen.
        <br>
        2.Makes Web Pages Attractive:
        Without CSS, web pages would look plain and boring. CSS helps make websites visually appealing and
        user-friendly.
        <br>
        3.Responsive Design:
        CSS helps make websites look good on all screen sizes — desktops, tablets, and mobile phones — using techniques
        like media queries.
        <br>
        4.Separates Content from Style:
        HTML is used for content, and CSS is used for styling. This makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.
        <br>
        5.Reusable and Efficient:
        You can write CSS once and apply it to multiple pages. This saves time and effort when updating styles.
        <br>
        6.Faster Loading with External CSS:
        If you use an external CSS file, browsers can cache it, which helps websites load faster.
        <br>
        7.Easy to Maintain and Update:
        If you want to change the look of your website, you can simply edit the CSS file instead of changing each HTML
        element.
